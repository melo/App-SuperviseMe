=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<supervise_me> command is a simple supervisor for multiple process.

It reads a list of commands to execute from C<STDIN> and starts each one,
and then monitors their execution. If one of the program dies, the supervisor
will restart it after a small 1 second pause.

You can exit the superviser with C<CTRL-C>, and all the child supervised
processes will be killed.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT
